# goDu

### What's up everyone!

goDu is a MVP (minimum viable product) Java project inspired by Splitwise app, an app to keep track of your shared expenses and balances with housemates, trips, groups, friends, and family.

This software were build for an OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) class, with the aim of learn and practice the goals of OOP.

Since it is a MVP, we abstracted a lot of features. The scenario is a planning trip with friends,  so we thought the most common expenses for a travel: transportation, lodging, food and airfare/transportation costs.

Different to Splitwise, there's no login, so all the users and groups can be create for you.

## So... Let's go Dutch?
